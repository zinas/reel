/**
 * I like breaking down css in many small files. First import base framework files
 * (like reset, mixins, variables, fonts, buttons, grid etc).
 *
 * Then continue with component specific styles. These should be kept to a minimum.
 * In general, components should be easily styled with the base styles, without many overrides
 *
 * Finally add page specific styles, which are non-reusable. Obviously these should be even less
 * than the component styles.
 *
 * I also like have a _shame.scss file where hacks are thrown into.
 *
 * By checking the number of lines in the last 2 sections, you can
 * get an indication of your technical debt
